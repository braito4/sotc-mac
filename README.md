  <strong>Shadow of the Colossus for Apple Silicon.</strong><br>
  An experimental macOS ARM64 port of the PS4 game, using native CPU translation. No Rosetta 2.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Early development: CPU diagnostics only. The game is not playable.**
>
> The original executable reaches part of its initialization through the ARM64 translator
> and through its interpreter. The original libc and Fios2 modules initialize successfully.
> This project does not yet provide a renderer, audio, a playable launcher or save support.
> There is no downloadable game app or gameplay performance result.
>
> The goal is to run Shadow of the Colossus on Apple Silicon without Rosetta. The current
> method translates PS4 x86-64 instructions to ARM64 at runtime; it is not a source rebuild
> of the game's engine.

## Features

- **Native Apple Silicon host:** the diagnostic and bbcpu are built as ARM64 binaries.
- **JIT and interpreter checks:** both modes are compared at explicit initialization boundaries.
- **Original system modules:** libc and Fios2 are linked from the user's own game dump.
- **Initial runtime support:** mutexes, read/write locks, destructor callbacks, clocks, timezone conversion,
  console output and direct/flexible memory queries.
- **Read-only content access:** a narrow file API tested with synthetic fixtures; no save mount.
- **Guest fibers:** suspension, resumption and switching preserve guest CPU state and stacks.
  Synthetic checks also cover resuming on another host thread.
- **Guest threads:** native pthread workers with separate guest stacks, static/module TLS,
  DTV tables and errno. Synthetic checks cover return, exit, join, detach and condition waits.
- **Local-content DiscMap profile:** optical bitmap queries report missing metadata without
  inventing disc locations. Internal module loading has checked argument and reference handling.
- **Local diagnostics:** generated game-derived images and execution logs remain outside Git.

## Getting started

1. Use an Apple Silicon Mac with Xcode Command Line Tools, CMake, Ninja and Python 3.
2. Initialize the pinned sources and build the CPU library using the
   [build guide](docs/guide/building.md).
3. Run the synthetic tests without game files:

   ```sh
   bash packaging/test-arm64.sh --contracts-test
   ```

4. For the optional initialization probe, prepare your own game files and follow
   [Game files](docs/guide/game-files.md).

The [installation guide](docs/guide/installation.md) explains the current developer-only workflow.

## Status

**Experimental, not playable.** Normal Terminal runs have completed both original module
initializers and the game's early memory setup. In the latest run, JIT and interpreter both
create Fios2's callback and I/O workers, then reach the same unresolved internal module-load
call requesting DiscMap. No game content was opened and no game fibers were created.

Guest fibers and the narrow system-module registry are implemented. Fiber synthetic tests pass
in both modes, including direct and PLT calls, stack/register/FPU preservation, contextless
restart and host-thread migration. Non-timed kernel read/write locks pass synthetic lifecycle,
ownership and concurrency tests in both modes. Checked thread creation and lifecycle operations
now pass synthetic tests with isolated per-thread TLS and concurrent read-only fixture I/O.
The new DiscMap profile and five-argument internal loader pass synthetic guest ABI and error
tests in both modes. Linked game progress after this addition still needs a normal Terminal run.

**Major remaining work:** the game's packed static pointers require a suitable address model;
the diagnostic's temporary high image mapping does not solve that. Game-level multithreading,
additional system services, content loading and graphics integration still need validation.

See [Development status](docs/STATUS.md) for the measured scope and next checks.

## Under the hood

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **sotc-mac** (this repository) | SotC adapters, CPU diagnostics, synthetic tests and documentation |
| `runtime/src/` | Scoped PS4 runtime adapters and the diagnostic loader |
| [bloodborne-runtime](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-runtime), `runtime/upstream/` | Pinned platform, memory, mutex, thread and file backends |
| [bloodborne-recomp](https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-recomp), `runtime/upstream/recomp/` | bbcpu: x86-64 decoder, interpreter and ARM64 translator |
| [ShadowOfTheColossus-PC](https://github.com/AjncSystem/ShadowOfTheColossus-PC), `reference/` | Pinned SotC input preparation and runtime reference |
| `tools/`, `tests/`, `packaging/` | Private module preparation, synthetic fixtures and build/test entry points |

Upstream sources are separate dependencies. This project adds adapters around them; it does
not rename Bloodborne's launcher or claim that its renderer already supports SotC.
