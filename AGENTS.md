# sotc-mac

This repository develops a native ARM64 macOS diagnostic for Shadow of the Colossus PS4.
Read README.md and docs/STATUS.md before changing the runtime. Public documentation is English.
Use docs/DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF.md for the current reproduction steps, stopping boundary and debugging priorities; keep it current when those change.
Use https://github.com/bloodborne-native/bloodborne-mac/ as the user's preferred upstream reference when resolving doubts. Follow its runtime/recomp links and review relevant changes against our pins; do not assume Bloodborne-specific layouts apply to SotC or silently update dependencies.

- Maintain code in runtime/src, tests, tools and packaging. work, game and logs are private
  local output/input; never promote their generated content into Git.
- Never publish game binaries, assets, extracted/generated game code, game addresses,
  execution logs, screenshots, recordings or saves. Original synthetic fixture sources are
  allowed. The game input must remain unchanged.
- Use the pinned upstream submodules. Read their instructions before editing them. Preserve
  credits to bloodborne-native, deadinside28/bbport, shadPS4 and the SotC reference project.
- Prefer real runtime contracts with explicit error behavior. Unknown imports stop; missing
  modules remain unavailable. Do not add blanket-success stubs to claim startup progress.
- Keep JIT/interpreter comparisons and meaningful guest ABI tests. Run contracts-test after
  runtime changes and native CPU checks when changing the CPU context bridge.
- The owner has visually confirmed game logos/menu and heard the opening introduction audio. Correct introduction video and audiovisual synchronization remain unverified. In-game 3D scenes, gameplay stability, a playable app and save support remain unverified. Keep claims tied to measured tests.
- Check the target remote before pushing. Keep private local state and archives ignored.
