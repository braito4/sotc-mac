# Reviewed renderer backports

These GPL-2.0-or-later patches come from bloodborne-native/bloodborne-runtime,
built on bbport and shadPS4. Original source copyright/license notices are preserved.
See [upstream review](../../docs/UPSTREAM_REVIEW.md) for exact commit links, scope,
validation and the cache-version adaptation.

`manifest.json` binds the pinned base, complete patch set, patch bytes and each
source file's before/after digest. Only the private `work/gpu-source` checkout is
adapted. Do not manually patch the pinned submodule or silently accept foreign
source changes. `tools/build_gpu.py` verifies and applies the set, then builds the
library and runs the real auxiliary shader regression.

Each `.patch.json` stores unified-diff lines, preserving significant blank context
without trailing whitespace in the repository. The builder reconstructs the patch
and feeds it directly to `git apply` after validating all input digests.
